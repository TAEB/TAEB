- Configurable botl
- Map keystrokes to actions (for an Interhack-like interface)
- Finish conversion to announcements
- Move the new_game attribute to Senses
- Make TAEB::Debug more pluggable
- use more consistent and useful logging levels
    - debug should be for things we don't generally care about
    - notify for most per-turn messages - this should be the default
    - info for special occurrences - identifying an item, etc
    - warning is fine
    - error for non-fatal errors
    - critical for fatal errors
- use some getopt module for bin/taeb
- use separate menus/keys for glyph modes and color modes
- items should know the container that they are in (inventory, tile,
    monster, other item), so that the ai doesn't have to search for things
    all the time
- collapsible menus
    - an arrayref item is a collapsed menu
- move "selection key" from Display::Curses into menu
